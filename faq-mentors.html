<p><strong>How do I apply?</strong></p>
<p>Fill out the <a href="https://datascience.wufoo.com/forms/2014-summer-fellowship-mentor-application/">application form</a>
by February 1, 2014</a></p>


<p><strong>What kind of mentors are you looking for?</strong></p>
<p>We're looking for data scientists with strong technical skills and practical experience with an interest in mentoring students learn real-world skills and make a social impact.
Last year, we had a mix of people from Industry and Academia (with practical, real-world experience) as mentors with Computer Science, Machine Learning, Statistics, Economics, Applied Math and Physics backgrounds</p>

<p><strong>Is it a full-time program and do I have to be in Chicago?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are looking for full-time mentors who can work with our team of fellows for the summer in Chicago. While we are grateful for part-time, volunteer help if you really want to help us, we are in need to dedicated, full-time, experienced mentors who can spend the entire summer in Chicago with our team of fellows.
</p>

<p><strong>When does the fellowship start and finish?</strong></p>
<p>We'll start end of May and finish end of August. We're working on figuring out multiple start dates that can accomodate different end of quarter/semester dates</p>


<p><strong>What if i can only help part-time?</strong></p>
<p>You should still email us and/or apply. We'll keep you informed on how we can use your help but we really need good, full-time mentors.
</p>

<p><strong>Do I get paid?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we do have funding for mentors. Feel free to email us with more questions about that.
</p>

<p><strong>When do I hear back from the fellowship?</strong></p>
<p>We'll review applications starting February 1 and will schedule interviews after we go through a round of reviewing. Final decisions will be sent out by March 1.
</p>

<p><strong>What projects am I going to be working on?</strong></p>
<p>Call for Projects is still on-going. You can see projects from last year <a href="projects/">here</a>. Projects will be in partnership with government and non profit organizations and will be in areas of 
 education, healthcare, energy, community development, disaster relief, and public safety. We'll send out a specific list of projects with our decision by March 15.
